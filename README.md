Running the Project
To start the project, you can run npm start. It launches the application in development mode and opens it in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

You can also run tests with npm test and build the app for production using npm run build. The latter optimizes the build for the best performance and prepares your app for deployment.

Ejecting
There's an option to run npm run eject, but be cautious because it's a one-way operation. Ejecting gives you full control over the build configuration but makes it harder to go back. You don't have to use eject unless you have specific customization needs.
